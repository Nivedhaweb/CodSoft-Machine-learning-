Credit card fraud detection using machine learning involves utilizing algorithms and statistical 
  models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in credit card data. By analyzing various 
  features such as transaction amount, location, time, and user behavior patterns, machine learning 
    models can learn to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. These models are trained on 
    historical data containing both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, enabling them to detect anomalies and flag suspicious 
      activities in real-time, thus helping financial institutions prevent fraudulent charges and protect their customers from unauthorized transactions.
